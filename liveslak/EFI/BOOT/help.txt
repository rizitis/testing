==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

To boot with default values just press ENTER.

=== Desktop Environment ===

0|1|2|3|4|5|6|S|s|single => Select a runlevel to start with. 
  The default is 4 for graphical login. 
 
kbd=fr xkb=ch,fr => Example of custom X keyboard layout.
 
livepw="somestring" => Change the password for user "live".
  The password is passed as a cleartext string.
  You can pass an empty string (livepw=) to remove the password.

locale=nl_NL kbd=nl tz=Europe/Amsterdam => Example of language, 
  keyboard and/or timezone customization. 
 
rootpw="somestring" => Change the password for user "root".
  The password is passed as a cleartext string.
  You can pass an empty string (rootpw=) to remove the password.

=== Custom software ===

load=nvidia => Load and configure Nvidia drivers if available 
  in the ISO. 
 
load=mod1[,mod2[...]] => Load one or more squashfs modules
  from the directory: "/liveslak/optional".
  By default none of these modules is loaded on boot.

noload=mod1[,mod2[...]] => Prevent loading of one or more
  squashfs modules from the directory "/liveslak/addons".
  By default all these modules are loaded on boot.

=== Network boot ===

dhcpwait=<numseconds> => Maximum wait time for the DHCP client to
  configure a network interface (default: 20 seconds).

nfsroot=ip.ad.dr.ess:/path/to/liveslak => defines the IP address
  of the NFS server, and the path to the extracted content
  of Slackware Live Edition.

nic=<driver>:<interface>:<dhcp|static>[:ipaddr:netmask[:gateway]]
  => network device customization, usually this parameter is
  not needed when your network runs a DHCP server.
  Specify a driver if UDEV does not detect the device. Specify the
  interface if Slackware Live can not figure it out. If you specify
  'static' you need to also specify ipaddr and netmask. The gateway
  is optional but needed to access the internet for instance.

=== Hardware related ===

localhd => initialize RAID/LVM on local hard drives.

tweaks=tweak1[,tweak2,[,...]] => Implemented tweaks:
  nga - no glamor 2D acceleration, avoids error "EGL_MESA_drm_image required".
  nsh - no sub-pixel hinting in freetype.
  tpb - enable TrackPoint scrolling while holding down middle mouse button.
  syn - start the syndaemon for better support of Synaptics touchpads.
  ssh - start SSH daemon (disabled by default).

nomodeset => Boot without kernel mode setting, needed with 
  some machines. 
 
rootdelay=10 => Add 10 second delay to give the kernel more 
  time to initialize USB. Try this if booting fails. Default is 5.

swap => Allow the Live OS to activate all swap partitions on
  the local hardware. By default, no swap is touched.

=== Media tweaks ===

cfg=[skip|write] =>
  Specify 'skip' to skip disk-based configuration file containing
  OS parameters; or specify 'write' to write current OS parameters
  to disk.

domain=your_custom_domain =>
  Specify a custom domain name.  Defaults to 'example.net'.

hostname=your_custom_hostname[,qualifier] =>
  Specify a custom hostname.  A qualifier 'fixed' can be appended
  to prohibit hostname modification in  case of network boot.

livemedia=/dev/sdX => Tell the init script which partition
  contains the Slackware Live OS you want to boot. This can
  become necessary if you have another copy of Slackware Live
  installed in another partition.

livemedia=/dev/sdX:/path/to/live.iso
livemedia=scandev:/path/to/live.iso => Use this if you want to
  load the live OS from an ISO file on a local harddisk partition.

livemain=directoryname => Use this if you copied the content
  of the ISO to a different directory than "liveslak".

luksvol=file1[:/mountpoint1][,file1[:/mountpoint2],...] =>
  Mount LUKS container "file1" at mount point "/mountpoint1".
  Multiple files should be separated with comma.
  Specify "luksvol=" to *prevent* mounting any LUKS container.

nop => No persistence, i.e. boot the virgin installation in
  case your "persistence" directory got corrupted.
  If you want to ignore any persistent data during boot,
  including LUKS data, specify "nop luksvol=" .

nop=wipe => Wipe all data from persistence directory or container.
  Useful in cases where your persistent data got corrupted.
 
persistence=directoryname => Use this if you want to use
  a different directory than "persistence" for storing
  persistent data.

persistence=/dev/sdX:/path/to/mypersistence
persistence=scandev:/path/to/mypersistence => Use this if
  the persistence directory or container is not located on the USB stick,
  but on a local hard disk partition. Useful for network (PXE) boot
  where you still want to offer users persistence.

toram => copy the OS from the media to to RAM before running it.
  You can remove the boot media after booting.

toram=all => Prevent writes to disk since we are supposed to
  run from RAM; equivalent to parameter "toram".

toram=os => Load OS modules into RAM, but write persistent data to USB.

=== Troubleshooting ===

blacklist=mod1[,mod2[...]]  => Add one or more kernel modules
  to the kernel blacklist to prevent them from loading, in case
  they cause issues during operation.

debug => During init, pause at strategic locations while as-
  sembling the overlay filesystem and show mount information.

rescue => After initialization, you will be dropped in a
  rescue shell to perform lowlevel maintenance.
