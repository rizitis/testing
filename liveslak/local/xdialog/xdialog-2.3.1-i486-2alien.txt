xdialog: xdialog (gtk-based 'dialog' replacement)
xdialog:
xdialog: Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the "dialog"
xdialog: or "cdialog" programs. It converts any terminal based program into
xdialog: a program with an X-windows interface. The dialogs are easier to
xdialog: see and use while adding even more functionalities (e.g. with the
xdialog: treeview, the file selector, the edit box, the range box, the help
xdialog: button/box). Because Xdialog uses GTK+, it will also match your
xdialog: desktop theme.
