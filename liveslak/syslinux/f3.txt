==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

To boot with default values just press ENTER.

=== Media tweaks ===

cfg=[skip|write] =>
  Specify 'skip' to skip disk-based configuration file containing
  OS parameters; or specify 'write' to write current OS parameters
  to disk.

domain=your_custom_domain =>
  Specify a custom domain name.  Defaults to 'example.net'.

hostname=your_custom_hostname[,qualifier] =>
  Specify a custom hostname.  A qualifier 'fixed' can be appended
  to prohibit hostname modification in  case of network boot.

livemedia=/dev/sdX => Tell the init script which partition
  contains the Slackware Live OS you want to boot. This can
  become necessary if you have another copy of Slackware Live
  installed in another partition.  Also accepted: UUID or LABEL.

livemedia=/dev/sdX:/path/to/live.iso
livemedia=scandev:/path/to/live.iso => Use this if you want to
  load the live OS from an ISO file on a local harddisk partition.

livemain=directoryname => Use this if you copied the content
  of the ISO to a different directory than "liveslak".

nop => No persistence, i.e. boot the virgin installation in
  case your "persistence" directory got corrupted.
  If you want to ignore any persistent data during boot,
  including LUKS data, specify "nop luksvol=" .

nop=wipe => Wipe all data from persistence directory or container.
  Useful in cases where your persistent data got corrupted.

persistence=name => Use this if you are using a different
  directory/file than "persistence" for storing persistent data.

persistence=/dev/sdX:/path/to/mypersistence
persistence=scandev:/path/to/mypersistence => Use this if
  the persistence directory or container is not located on the USB stick,
  but on a local hard disk partition. Useful for network (PXE) boot
  where you still want to offer users persistence.

toram => copy the OS from the media to to RAM before running it.
  You can remove the boot media after booting.

toram=all => Prevent writes to disk since we are supposed to
  run from RAM; equivalent to parameter "toram".

toram=os => Load OS modules into RAM, but write persistent data to USB.
