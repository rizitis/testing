If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
below after the name of the kernel to boot (default: live).

To test your memory with memtest86+, enter memtest on the boot line below.

This prompt is just for entering extra parameters.  If you don't need to enter
any parameters, hit ENTER to boot with default values or press [F2] 
for a listing of customization choices.  Default kernel will boot in 30 seconds.
